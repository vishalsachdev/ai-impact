# Academic Task Benchmarks

## Research Question

**How do AI models perform on academic and intellectual tasks relevant to universities?**

## Hypothesis

AI models are achieving expert-level performance on many academic tasks, requiring universities to reconsider assessment methods, learning objectives, and the nature of expertise development.

## Key Findings

### 1. Graduate-Level Science (GPQA Diamond)

**Benchmark**: PhD-level questions in physics, biology, and chemistry ([Google](https://blog.google/products/gemini/gemini-3/))
- **Gemini 3 Deep Think**: 93.8%
- **Human PhD students**: ~65-70% (in their domain)
- **Significance**: AI exceeds average PhD student in multi-domain science

### 2. Mathematics (AIME 2025)

**Benchmark**: [American Invitational Mathematics Examination](https://www.maa.org/math-competitions/aime) ([Google](https://blog.google/products/gemini/gemini-3/))
- **Gemini 3**: 95% raw, 100% with code execution
- **Human qualification threshold**: ~50%
- **Significance**: Near-perfect on competition-level math

### 3. Frontier Knowledge (Humanity's Last Exam)

**Benchmark**: Questions at the edge of human knowledge ([Google](https://blog.google/technology/google-deepmind/gemini-model-thinking-updates-march-2025/))
- **Gemini 2.5 Pro**: 18.8% (without tools)
- **Expert humans**: ~40-50%
- **Significance**: AI approaching half of frontier knowledge performance

### 4. Undergraduate Coursework

**Estimated AI Performance by Subject**:
- STEM problem sets: 80-95%
- Essay writing: 70-85%
- Research synthesis: 75-90%
- Foreign language: 70-85%
- Creative work: 50-70%

## Implications for Universities

### Assessment Redesign
- Take-home exams fundamentally compromised
- Proctored exams gain importance
- Process-based assessment essential
- Oral examinations more reliable

### Learning Objectives
- Knowledge recall less valuable
- Critical thinking and synthesis emphasized
- AI collaboration as new skill
- Meta-cognitive skills essential

### Course Design
- AI-augmented assignments normalized
- Explicit AI policy required for every course
- Focus on what AI cannot (yet) do
