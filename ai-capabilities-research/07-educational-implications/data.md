## Academic Integrity Framework

### Policy Spectrum

| Level | Description | Example Contexts |
|-------|-------------|------------------|
| 1: Prohibited | No AI use allowed | Learning fundamentals, exams |
| 2: Restricted | Limited AI use with approval | Brainstorming only |
| 3: Permitted | AI use allowed with attribution | General assignments |
| 4: Encouraged | AI use expected | Professional preparation |
| 5: Required | Must use AI | AI collaboration assessments |

### Attribution Standards

**Recommended Attribution Format**:
```
AI Assistance Declaration:
- Tool used: [Model name and version]
- Nature of assistance: [Description]
- Human contribution: [Description]
```

### Enforcement Considerations

**Detection Limitations**:
- AI detection tools unreliable (high false positive/negative rates)
- Stylistic analysis limited
- Paraphrased content difficult to detect

**Recommended Approach**:
- Focus on learning objectives, not policing
- Assess what students can do, not just produce
- Use verification (oral defense) over detection
- Clear expectations reduce violations

## Research Workflow Integration

### AI-Assisted Research Guidelines

**Appropriate Uses**:
- Literature search and organization
- Draft generation and editing
- Data analysis assistance
- Code generation
- Visualization creation

**Requires Disclosure**:
- Substantial text generation
- Analytical methods suggested by AI
- Code written by AI

**Inappropriate Uses**:
- Fabricating data or sources
- Misrepresenting AI work as human
- Using AI to bypass ethical review

### Attribution in Publications

**Emerging Standards**:
- Disclose AI assistance in methods
- Specify which sections AI-assisted
- Human responsibility for content
- No AI as co-author (generally)

### Reproducibility Considerations

- Document AI tools and versions used
- Include prompts for critical analyses
- Verify AI-generated code/analysis
- Human verification of key findings
