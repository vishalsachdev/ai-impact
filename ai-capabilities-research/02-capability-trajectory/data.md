## Economic Impact Projections

### [McKinsey Global Institute](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/the-economic-potential-of-generative-ai-the-next-productivity-frontier)

**Key Findings**:
- Generative AI could add $2.6-4.4 trillion annually to global economy
- Equivalent to adding entire UK GDP
- 75% of value in four areas:
  1. Customer operations
  2. Marketing and sales
  3. Software engineering
  4. R&D

**Labor Impact**:
- Could automate 60-70% of current work activities
- Accelerate labor productivity growth by 0.1-0.6%/year
- Could add 0.5-3.4% to global GDP growth annually

### PricewaterhouseCoopers (PWC)

**Projections**:
- AI contribution to global GDP: $15.7 trillion by 2030
- Breakdown:
  - Productivity gains: $6.6 trillion
  - Consumption effects: $9.1 trillion
- Largest gains: China (26% GDP boost), North America (14%)

### [International Monetary Fund (IMF)](https://www.imf.org/en/publications/wp/issues/2025/04/04/ai-adoption-and-inequality-565729)

**Key Findings**:
- ~40% of global employment exposed to AI
- Advanced economies: 60% exposure (mixed impact)
- Emerging markets: 40% exposure (fewer benefits initially)
- Low-income countries: 26% exposure (risk of widening gap)

**Inequality Concerns**:
- AI may increase income and wealth inequality
- High-skill workers benefit most from augmentation
- Lower-skill workers face displacement risk
