# Capability Trajectory & Economic Impact

## Research Question

**How fast are AI capabilities improving, and what are the projected economic impacts?**

## Hypothesis

AI capabilities are improving at an accelerating rate that outpaces institutional adaptation cycles, with transformative economic implications requiring proactive university response.

## Key Findings

### 1. Improvement Rates (2024-2025)

| Model Transition | Timeframe | Improvement | Benchmark | Source |
|------------------|-----------|-------------|-----------|--------|
| GPT-4o → GPT-5 | 14 months | >2x | GDPval expert parity | [OpenAI](https://openai.com/index/gdpval/) |
| Gemini 2.5 → 3 | 7 months | 50% | Developer tasks | [Google](https://blog.google/products/gemini/gemini-3/) |
| Claude 4.1 → 4.5 | 3 months | 74.5% → 80.9% | SWE-bench | [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-opus-4-5) |

### 2. Key Trajectory Observations

- **Linear improvement on GDPval**: Performance improving roughly linearly over time
- **Accelerating release cycles**: Major models released every 3-7 months
- **Cross-lab convergence**: Top models clustering in performance
- **Specialization emerging**: Different models excel at different tasks

### 3. Economic Impact Projections

| Source | Projection | Timeframe |
|--------|------------|-----------|
| [McKinsey](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/the-economic-potential-of-generative-ai-the-next-productivity-frontier) | $4.4 trillion/year | Annual potential |
| PWC | $15.7 trillion | Global GDP by 2030 |
| [IMF](https://www.imf.org/en/publications/wp/issues/2025/04/04/ai-adoption-and-inequality-565729) | 0.6% productivity growth boost | Annual |
| Market size | $243.72B → $826.73B | 2025 → 2030 |

### 4. Labor Market Implications

- **40% of global employment** exposed to AI ([IMF](https://www.imf.org/en/publications/wp/issues/2025/04/04/ai-adoption-and-inequality-565729))
- **High-skill workers** most exposed but also most augmented
- **Emerging economies** potentially disadvantaged by slower adoption

## Implications for Universities

### Strategic Planning
- 3-5 year curriculum cycles may be too slow
- Capability assumptions obsolete within 1-2 years
- Continuous curriculum updating required

### Workforce Preparation
- Students entering workforce face different AI landscape than during training
- Adaptability and AI collaboration skills essential
- Domain expertise remains valuable anchor

### Research Prioritization
- AI capabilities research itself rapidly changing
- Cross-disciplinary AI literacy needed
- Ethics and governance research increasingly urgent
