# Agentic Capabilities

## Research Question

**What autonomous, multi-step work can AI perform?**

## Hypothesis

AI is transitioning from tool (requiring human prompting at each step) to agent (capable of autonomous multi-step workflows), with significant implications for task delegation and workforce augmentation.

## Key Findings

### 1. OSWorld (Computer Use)

**Benchmark**: Real desktop and web tasks on virtual machines ([Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-opus-4-5))

| Model | Score | Date |
|-------|-------|------|
| Claude Opus 4.5 | **61.4%** | Nov 2025 |
| Other frontier models | 30-50% | 2025 |

**Task Examples**:
- Navigate web applications
- Fill out forms
- Manage files and folders
- Execute multi-step workflows

### 2. Autonomous Refinement

**Anthropic Finding**: Claude agents can autonomously refine their own outputs ([Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/research/how-ai-is-transforming-work-at-anthropic))
- Peak performance achieved in **4 iterations**
- Other models couldn't match quality after 10 iterations
- Self-correction without human intervention

### 3. Multi-Step Task Completion

AI can now autonomously:
- Research topics across multiple sources
- Write and edit documents iteratively
- Execute code and debug based on errors
- Manage project workflows
- Coordinate multi-tool operations

### 4. Current Limitations

- Reliability degrades with task length
- Novel situations cause failures
- Error recovery still imperfect
- Human oversight still necessary for high-stakes tasks

## Implications for Universities

### Task Delegation
- Administrative workflows increasingly automatable
- Research assistance at higher level of autonomy
- Student support services augmented

### Teaching Agentic AI
- New curriculum area: AI agent design and oversight
- Ethics of delegation and accountability
- Human-agent collaboration skills

### Research Workflows
- Literature review automation
- Data collection and processing agents
- Experiment monitoring and adjustment
