# Research Question 6: Use Case Evolution Over Time

## Primary Question
How are AI use cases evolving across platforms, and what does this reveal about user learning, platform maturation, and market trajectories?

## Key Hypothesis
AI use cases are broadening from technical early-adopter tasks toward mainstream personal and professional applications, with different platforms following different evolutionary paths.

## Significance
Understanding use case evolution is critical for:
- Predicting future AI application areas
- Platform positioning and feature development
- Identifying emerging market opportunities
- Understanding user sophistication progression
- Labor market impact forecasting
