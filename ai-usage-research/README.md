## Research Questions

### [01. Automation vs Augmentation Patterns](./01-automation-vs-augmentation/)

**Key Question**: How are users interacting with AI—as automation tools (directive task completion) versus augmentation tools (collaborative interaction)?

**Key Findings**:
- Historic shift in Aug 2025: First time automation (39%) approached augmentation levels ([Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/research/anthropic-economic-index-september-2025-report))
- 77% of business API use is automation (full task delegation) ([Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/research/anthropic-economic-index-september-2025-report))
- 73% of ChatGPT use is personal/advisory (augmentation-focused) ([OpenAI](https://openai.com/index/how-people-are-using-chatgpt/))
- Platform divergence: ChatGPT → personal advisor, Claude → work automation engine ([Fortune](https://fortune.com/2025/09/15/openai-chatgpt-claude-anthropic-work-personal-use-new-data/))

**Significance**: Reveals "Tale of Two AIs" - businesses automating while individuals seeking advice

## Key Statistics Summary

| Platform | MAU/WAU | Market Share (US) | Primary Use | Enterprise Focus |
|----------|---------|-------------------|-------------|------------------|
| ChatGPT | 700-800M WAU | 59.7% | Personal advisor | Growing |

## Overarching Themes

### Theme 1: The Great Divergence
Two parallel AI revolutions:
- **Individuals**: AI as personal advisor for life decisions (ChatGPT)
- **Businesses**: AI as automation engine for work (Claude, Copilot)

### Theme 2: Demographic Revolution
- Gender parity in ~12 months (fastest of any major technology) ([OpenAI](https://openai.com/index/how-people-are-using-chatgpt/))
- Emerging economies growing 4x faster than wealthy countries ([OpenAI](https://openai.com/index/how-people-are-using-chatgpt/))
- Youth domination but broader than expected (32% are 35-54) ([DemandSage](https://www.demandsage.com/chatgpt-statistics/))

### Theme 3: Platform Specialization
- ChatGPT → Consumer, personal, exploratory
- Claude → Enterprise, coding, automation
- Gemini → Integration, education, ecosystem
- Copilot → Workplace, Microsoft ecosystem

### Theme 4: Global Inequality Paradox
- Fast growth in poor countries ≠ high absolute usage ([OpenAI](https://openai.com/index/how-people-are-using-chatgpt/))
- Singapore uses 23x more than Nigeria ([Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/research/anthropic-economic-index-september-2025-report))
- Risk of widening inequality despite convergent growth rates ([IMF](https://www.imf.org/en/publications/wp/issues/2025/04/04/ai-adoption-and-inequality-565729))

### Theme 5: Privacy Bifurcation
- Consumer: Data as product (Terms of Service)
- Enterprise: Privacy as product (Data Processing Addendums)
- Markets splitting into "parallel universes"

### Theme 6: Use Case Maturation
- From technical → mainstream
- From work → personal (ChatGPT)
- From collaboration → automation (Claude)
- Broadening beyond early adopters

## Data Gaps & Research Needs

### Missing Data
1. **Cross-platform usage**: What % of users multi-home?
2. **Comprehensive demographics**: Limited data beyond ChatGPT
3. **Country-level detail**: Most nations not covered
4. **Urban vs rural**: No platform reports this split
5. **Economic outcomes**: Impact measurement lacking
6. **Longitudinal trends**: Need multi-year tracking

### Methodological Challenges
1. **Different sampling methods**: Platform studies use varied approaches
2. **Privacy-preserving analysis**: Limits granularity
3. **Self-selection bias**: Users opt into studies
4. **Geographic restrictions**: Data collection barriers
5. **Definition inconsistency**: "Usage" defined differently across platforms

### Future Research Questions
1. What explains the automation/augmentation divergence?
2. Why are emerging economies leading adoption?
3. How sustainable is current inequality trajectory?
4. What drives platform specialization patterns?
5. Will specialization persist or converge?
6. Do users become more sophisticated over time?
