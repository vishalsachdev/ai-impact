# Research Question 1: Automation vs Augmentation Patterns

## Primary Question
How are users interacting with AI platforms—as automation tools (directive task completion) versus augmentation tools (collaborative interaction)?

## Key Hypothesis
There is a fundamental divergence emerging between how businesses deploy AI (automation) versus how individuals use AI (augmentation/advisory).

## Significance
Understanding this split is critical for:
- Predicting future AI development priorities
- Labor market impact assessment
- Educational curriculum design
- Policy interventions around AI deployment

## Key Findings Summary
- **Historic shift (August 2025)**: First time automation (39%) exceeded augmentation (61%) in Anthropic's data
- **Business vs Consumer divide**: 77% of business API use is automation, while 73% of ChatGPT use is personal/advisory
- **Platform specialization**: ChatGPT → personal advisor, Claude → work automation engine
- **Productivity gains**: 70% of Copilot users felt more productive, 29% faster at core tasks
