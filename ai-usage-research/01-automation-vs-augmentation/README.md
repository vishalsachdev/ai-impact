# Research Question 1: Automation vs Augmentation Patterns

## Primary Question
How are users interacting with AI platforms—as automation tools (directive task completion) versus augmentation tools (collaborative interaction)?

## Key Hypothesis
There is a fundamental divergence emerging between how businesses deploy AI (automation) versus how individuals use AI (augmentation/advisory).

## Significance
Understanding this split is critical for:
- Predicting future AI development priorities
- Labor market impact assessment
- Educational curriculum design
- Policy interventions around AI deployment

## Key Findings Summary
- **Historic shift (August 2025)**: First time automation (39%) exceeded augmentation (61%) in Anthropic's data ([Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/research/anthropic-economic-index-september-2025-report))
- **Business vs Consumer divide**: 77% of business API use is automation ([Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/research/anthropic-economic-index-september-2025-report)), while 73% of ChatGPT use is personal/advisory ([OpenAI](https://openai.com/index/how-people-are-using-chatgpt/))
- **Platform specialization**: ChatGPT → personal advisor, Claude → work automation engine ([Fortune](https://fortune.com/2025/09/15/openai-chatgpt-claude-anthropic-work-personal-use-new-data/))
- **Productivity gains**: 70% of Copilot users felt more productive, 29% faster at core tasks ([Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/worklab/work-trend-index/copilots-earliest-users-teach-us-about-generative-ai-at-work))
