# Research Question 4: Global Inequality in AI Access & Adoption

## Primary Question
How is AI adoption distributed globally, and is AI widening or narrowing global inequality gaps?

## Key Hypothesis
Despite rapid growth in emerging economies, AI adoption may paradoxically widen global inequality due to absolute usage gaps, infrastructure barriers, and differential economic impacts.

## Significance
Understanding global inequality in AI is critical for:
- Development policy and international aid priorities
- Predicting economic divergence between nations
- Designing inclusive AI systems and policies
- Infrastructure investment strategies
- Educational equity initiatives

## Key Findings Summary
- **The Paradox**: Growth fastest in poor countries (4x), but absolute usage highest in rich countries ([OpenAI](https://openai.com/index/how-people-are-using-chatgpt/))
- **Extreme disparities**: Singapore uses AI 23x more than Nigeria (AUI: 4.6 vs 0.20) ([Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/research/anthropic-economic-index-september-2025-report))
- **Adoption gap**: Global North 23%, Global South 13% (10 pp difference) ([IMF](https://www.imf.org/en/publications/wp/issues/2025/04/04/ai-adoption-and-inequality-565729))
- **Economic impact**: AI growth in advanced economies projected >2x that of low-income countries ([IMF](https://www.imf.org/en/publications/wp/issues/2025/04/04/ai-adoption-and-inequality-565729))
- **Emerging leaders**: India, Brazil, Mexico, South Africa have highest adoption rates despite lower absolute usage ([Modern Diplomacy](https://moderndiplomacy.eu/2025/03/04/why-is-ai-adoption-slower-in-the-global-south-and-how-can-it-leap-forward/))
- **Infrastructure barriers**: 25% of Asia-Pacific offline, women in South Asia 40% less likely to own smartphones ([OECD-Cisco](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/oecd-cisco-research-finds-stark-geographical-and-generational-divides-in-ai-uptake-and-digital-well-being-302632418.html))
- **Speed vs equity**: AI adoption happening in months (not decades), many countries lack infrastructure/skills/governance ([UN](https://www.euronews.com/next/2025/12/02/ai-race-is-faster-than-countries-can-adapt-threatening-greater-global-inequality-un-report))
