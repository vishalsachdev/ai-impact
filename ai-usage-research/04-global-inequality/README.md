# Research Question 4: Global Inequality in AI Access & Adoption

## Primary Question
How is AI adoption distributed globally, and is AI widening or narrowing global inequality gaps?

## Key Hypothesis
Despite rapid growth in emerging economies, AI adoption may paradoxically widen global inequality due to absolute usage gaps, infrastructure barriers, and differential economic impacts.

## Significance
Understanding global inequality in AI is critical for:
- Development policy and international aid priorities
- Predicting economic divergence between nations
- Designing inclusive AI systems and policies
- Infrastructure investment strategies
- Educational equity initiatives

## Key Findings Summary
- **The Paradox**: Growth fastest in poor countries (4x), but absolute usage highest in rich countries
- **Extreme disparities**: Singapore uses AI 23x more than Nigeria (AUI: 4.6 vs 0.20)
- **Adoption gap**: Global North 23%, Global South 13% (10 pp difference)
- **Economic impact**: AI growth in advanced economies projected >2x that of low-income countries
- **Emerging leaders**: India, Brazil, Mexico, South Africa have highest adoption rates despite lower absolute usage
- **Infrastructure barriers**: 25% of Asia-Pacific offline, women in South Asia 40% less likely to own smartphones
- **Speed vs equity**: AI adoption happening in months (not decades), many countries lack infrastructure/skills/governance
