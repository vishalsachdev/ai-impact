# Global Inequality in AI: Detailed Data

## The Central Paradox

**Growth Rates:**
- Lowest income countries: Growth rate in AI adoption
- Highest income countries: Growth rate / 4
- **Emerging economies growing 4x faster**

**Absolute Usage:**
- Singapore: 4.6x expected usage (AI Usage Index)
- Nigeria: 0.20x expected usage
- **23x disparity** (4.6 / 0.20)

**Interpretation:**
- Poor countries adopting faster (percentage growth)
- Rich countries using more (absolute levels)
- Gap may be widening despite convergent growth rates

---

## Regional Inequality Metrics

### [Anthropic AI Usage Index](https://www.anthropic.com/research/anthropic-economic-index-september-2025-report) (AUI)

**Definition**: Multiplier of expected usage based on population and GDP

**High-Usage Countries:**
- Singapore: 4.6x expected
- Canada: 2.9x expected
- Interpretation: Wealthy, technologically advanced nations

**Low-Usage Countries:**
- India: 0.27x expected
- Nigeria: 0.20x expected
- Interpretation: Large populations, lower per-capita usage

**Regional Patterns:**
- Wealthy English-speaking countries: High AUI
- Large emerging economies: Low AUI (despite high absolute numbers)
- Sub-Saharan Africa: Lowest AUI

2. **Within-country inequality**: No urban/rural, rich/poor regional data
3. **Usage quality**: Access ≠ effective usage
4. **Longitudinal trends**: Need multi-year tracking to see if gaps widen/narrow
5. **Impact measurement**: Economic outcomes from AI usage by region

---

## Summary: The Inequality Dilemma

**The Optimistic View:**
- Emerging economies growing 4x faster
- Mobile-first populations leapfrogging
- AI providing educational/health resources where lacking
- Market forces creating incentives to serve poor countries

**The Pessimistic View:**
- Absolute usage gaps remain enormous (23x)
- Economic impact differential >2x favors rich
- Infrastructure barriers exclude 25% entirely
- Speed of change prevents gradual adaptation
- Complementarity requirements favor wealthy nations

**The Likely Reality:**
- Both occurring simultaneously
- % convergence + absolute divergence
- Creating new forms of inequality
- Intervention needed to prevent worst outcomes

**Critical Metric:**
- Not just who uses AI
- But who benefits economically from AI
- Early evidence suggests: Wealthy benefit more
