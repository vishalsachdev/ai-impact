# Research Question 2: Platform Specialization Patterns

## Primary Question
Are AI platforms specializing for different use cases, user segments, and interaction paradigms? If so, what drives this specialization?

## Key Hypothesis
Market forces and user behavior are driving AI platforms toward distinct niches rather than head-to-head competition across all use cases.

## Significance
Understanding platform specialization is critical for:
- Predicting competitive dynamics in AI market
- Understanding user choice and switching behavior
- Platform strategy and positioning
- Feature development priorities
- Market structure (oligopoly vs monopoly tendencies)
