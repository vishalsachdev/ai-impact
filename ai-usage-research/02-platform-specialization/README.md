# Research Question 2: Platform Specialization Patterns

## Primary Question
Are AI platforms specializing for different use cases, user segments, and interaction paradigms? If so, what drives this specialization?

## Key Hypothesis
Market forces and user behavior are driving AI platforms toward distinct niches rather than head-to-head competition across all use cases.

## Significance
Understanding platform specialization is critical for:
- Predicting competitive dynamics in AI market
- Understanding user choice and switching behavior
- Platform strategy and positioning
- Feature development priorities
- Market structure (oligopoly vs monopoly tendencies)

## Key Findings Summary
- **ChatGPT**: Dominating consumer market (59.7% share), personal advisor role, exploratory use ([SQ Magazine](https://sqmagazine.co.uk/chatgpt-vs-google-gemini-statistics/))
- **Claude**: Enterprise coding focus (36% of usage), automation engine, developer-first approach ([Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/research/anthropic-economic-index-september-2025-report))
- **Gemini**: Enterprise integration specialist (63% enterprise users), Google Workspace embedding ([SQ Magazine](https://sqmagazine.co.uk/google-gemini-ai-statistics/))
- **Copilot**: Workplace productivity (90%+ Fortune 500), Microsoft ecosystem integration ([Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2025/11/18/microsoft-ignite-2025-copilot-and-agents-built-to-power-the-frontier-firm/))
