# Research Question 5: Enterprise vs Consumer Usage Patterns

## Primary Question
How do enterprise and consumer AI usage differ in adoption patterns, use cases, pricing models, and privacy requirements?

## Key Hypothesis
AI platforms are bifurcating into parallel markets with fundamentally different value propositions, privacy architectures, and business models for enterprise vs consumer segments.

## Significance
Understanding enterprise-consumer divergence is critical for:
- Platform strategy and feature prioritization
- Privacy and security policy design
- Pricing and business model optimization
- Regulatory approaches (consumer protection vs business contracts)
- Competitive dynamics and market structure
