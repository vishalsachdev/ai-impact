# AI Impact Research

Comprehensive research on AI from frontier labs: usage patterns, capabilities, trajectories, and implications for higher education.

## Two Research Tracks

This repository contains two complementary research compilations:

| Track | Focus | Audience |
|-------|-------|----------|
| **[AI Usage Research](ai-usage-research/)** | How people use AI | General |
| **[AI Capabilities Research](ai-capabilities-research/)** | What AI can do | University stakeholders |

## AI Usage Research

**How people use AI platforms from Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, and Microsoft.**

### Quick Links

- [01. Automation vs Augmentation](ai-usage-research/01-automation-vs-augmentation/)
- [02. Platform Specialization](ai-usage-research/02-platform-specialization/)
- [03. Demographics & Adoption](ai-usage-research/03-demographics-adoption/)
- [04. Global Inequality](ai-usage-research/04-global-inequality/)
- [05. Enterprise vs Consumer](ai-usage-research/05-enterprise-vs-consumer/)
- [06. Use Case Evolution](ai-usage-research/06-use-case-evolution/)

### Key Findings

- **Gender Parity Achieved**: ChatGPT now 52.4% female users (fastest of any major tech)
- **Automation Rising**: Claude automation usage 27% → 39% (2024-2025)
- **Global Paradox**: Emerging economies growing 4x faster but usage 23x lower
- **Teen Adoption**: 64% of U.S. teens use AI chatbots, 28% daily
- **Enterprise Standard**: 90%+ Fortune 500 using Microsoft Copilot

- [06. Safety and Alignment](ai-capabilities-research/06-safety-and-alignment/)
- [07. Educational Implications](ai-capabilities-research/07-educational-implications/)

### Key Findings

- **Expert Parity**: ~50% of professional tasks at expert level (GDPval)
- **Coding Leader**: Claude Opus 4.5 at 80.9% SWE-bench (first to exceed best human)
- **PhD-Level Science**: Gemini 3 at 93.8% on GPQA Diamond
- **100x Advantage**: AI completes tasks 100x faster and cheaper than experts
- **Rapid Improvement**: Capabilities doubled in 14 months (GPT-4o → GPT-5)
